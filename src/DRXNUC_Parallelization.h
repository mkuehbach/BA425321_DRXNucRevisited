	drxnuc --- this program implements functionality to study the effect of
	dislocation density gradients on the 1d migration of (discontinuously) dynamically
	recrystallizing nuclei.

	The source code was developed by Markus K\"uhbach during his postdoc with the Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur
	Eisenforschung GmbH in D\"usseldorf, contact should be directed to m.kuehbach at mpie.de
